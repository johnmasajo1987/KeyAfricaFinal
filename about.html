                <h4>Our Story</h4>
                <p>Key Africa’s venture into the healthcare sector in Africa began with a more general exploratory trip, hoping to find business opportunities for Israeli investors. As we traveled around Tanzania in 2018 and got to know the country better, our eyes were opened wide to the state of the country’s healthcare system.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Tanzania’s healthcare industry landscape is one filled with contradictions. On the one hand, we bore witness to ill-equipped hospitals with unsanitary conditions; on the other, we saw towering medical facilities funded by foreign money that was physically and economically out of reach for the common Tanzanian. We saw upscale medical equipment languishing unused in hospitals due to a lack of knowledgeable personnel to operate them.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>But with these gaps and contradictions comes great opportunity, and a way to dramatically improve the country’s healthcare infrastructure and the public’s access to it. Our founders re-calibrated Key Africa’s focus and came up with a plan to open Africa’s doors to world-class healthcare, starting in Tanzania.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>We collaborated with Terem, Israel’s most renowned primary healthcare provider, to facilitate skills and technology transfer to local healthcare workers, as we worked closely with individuals and companies looking to invest in the rapidly growing African healthcare market. We see this as a way to increase local workforce knowledge, help the communities gain better healthcare access, and offer investors a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The Key Africa footprint is top-quality care with deep community roots; a quality of care that is sensitive to the nuances of the communities it serves. We believe that this is our recipe for long-term success in the continent and a genuinely repeatable and financially viable formula.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Key Africa is in Africa to stay. We view the improvement of African healthcare services more than just a business; we view it as a vocation. It is a commitment to a community we want to help, serve, and improve using our entrepreneurial knowledge, business network, and community connections.</p>

                <h4>Who We Are</h4>
                <p>
                  Key Africa is an enterprise aimed at ushering a new era of top-notch healthcare in Africa, one community at a time, through the strategic establishment of Primary Care Facilities (PCFs), skills and knowledge transfer, and medical research and development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We recognize the pressing demand for world-class healthcare solutions in the continent, and we commit to meet this demand by investing in healthcare infrastructure at par with the highest global standards yet maintaining deep community roots.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Our partnership with Terem, one of Israel’s largest emergency care providers, ensures that our facilities uphold the highest standards of care, employ the most competent medical professionals, facilitate the efficient transfer of skills and knowledge to the local workforce, and endeavor in improving our service delivery through research and development. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Our flagship facility shall be the Luther Hospital in the Ubungo District of Dar Es Salam, set to open in September 2021, and the result of a successful partnership with the Lutheran Church of Tanzania. Our shared mission to be in the service of the sick in their community has propelled the project.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  We at Key Africa envision being the continent’s largest and most trusted healthcare provider in the next decade, with plans to build 3 additional facilities within Tanzania over the next three years, as we expand the service offering of our flagship facility. Ultimately, we envision having 50 such facilities in the continent by 2030. These we shall achieve through our highly experienced management team, consistent quality of care, and meaningful engagement with the various shareholders in the communities we serve.

                  The community is an important stakeholder in our enterprise. Therefore, we commit to working closely with the communities we serve to ensure that their primary medical needs are met and that the quality care we provide is accessible to all within the community.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  A well-trained team is a key to running a successful healthcare business, and Key Africa shall invest time and resources towards training and continuing professional development, as well as technology and skills transfer to the local workforce.

                <br>
                <p>
